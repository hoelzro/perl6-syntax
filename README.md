# Perl 6 Syntax

Files that add syntax highlighting support to editors for Perl 6.

To run the tests, you'll need the following;

  - kate editor support (Perl 5)
  - pygments (Python)
  - vim (Perl 5)

## Possibly supported future editors

If enough people ask for it:

  - Emacs (I'm sure this will be there)
  - Light Table
  - Atom
